# earlyDetectionAndAlertingSystemForForestFire
The main aim of this project is to monitor atmospheric conditions in the Forest ,alerts when the parameters hits the threshold values and if we send a message to it then it sends back the current parameters levels. it is an SMS based system. I used Arduino-NANO, SIM900a, GPS, Flame sensor, Smoke sensor-MQ2 and temparature sensor
